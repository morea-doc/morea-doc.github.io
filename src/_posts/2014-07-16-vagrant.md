Users have reported problems installing Ruby and Jekyll under Windows 8.   We have created a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) "box" that simplifies the process of running a virtual Unix environment on Windows with Python, Ruby, git, and Jekyll pre-installed. 

For details on how to run Morea using Vagrant, see the [Vagrant QuickStart page](/quickstart-vagrant.html).
