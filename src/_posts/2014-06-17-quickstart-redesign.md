The original QuickStart procedure directed you to fork the basic-template repository in order to initialize your own course website. 

Unfortunately, GitHub does not allow forks of public repositories (like basic-template) to be made private.  

The [QuickStart page](/quickstart.html) has now been modified to avoid the use of forking.  Course repositories created using the new procedure can be made private.
