# Basic concepts

To begin, here are some basic ideas underlying the framework.

### One markdown file for each Morea entity

Every Morea entity (module, outcome, reading, experience, assessment) is represented by a single markdown file.

There can also be other markdown files and other non-markdown files (such as the logo image file associated with each module).

### Content is in morea/

When you first clone a Morea site, you will find a potentially bewildering number of files and directories:

<img src="images/morea-source.png" width="200px" />

Fortunately, the only files you need to maintain are all located in the src/morea directory.

All other files can be ignored until you want to do advanced modification of the framework itself.

### Organize the morea/ directory as you like

The way you organize the morea/ directory is up to you.  You can place all of the files directly within
this directory, or create subdirectories.

### Name Morea files as you like

The way you name Morea files is also up to you.
