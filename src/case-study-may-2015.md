# User Evaluation of the Morea Framework 

## Summary

In May, 2015, the instructors for five courses whose websites were built using the Morea Framework asked their students to fill out an online survey asking their opinion of the course website. Out of the 175 students who received the request, 119 responded, for a participation rate of 68%. One course was 200 level, two were 300 level, one was 400 level, and one was a 600 (graduate) level. Four of the courses were in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences, and one was in the Department of Information and Technology Management. All were at the University of Hawaii.

The goal of the survey was to determine if end-users find that the Morea Framework provides a useful alternative to learning management systems such as Laulima.  And if so, what changes or enhancements would end-users find desirable. 

Survey results indicate that user satisfaction with the Morea Framework course websites is quite high: 70% of respondents prefer it to Laulima in particular and 63% find it easier to use than other course websites in general.

In conclusion, the evidence from this survey suggests that the Morea Framework does provide a useful  approach to course website design and that further development and use is warranted.

The following sections present the survey data in more detail. 

## Question 1: Evaluation of Morea page structure

While instructors are free to customize the top-level page structure of a Morea website, all of the instructors in this survey chose to retain the "standard" five pages (though all did augment them with additional pages). The first question asked users to evaluate the usefulness of the five standard Morea pages:

{% include case-study-image.html src="question1-pages.png" %}

Here is a summary of the responses:

{% include case-study-image.html src="question1-summary.jpg" %}

These results show that most users found all of the standard Morea pages to either useful or extremely useful. The standard pages did differ with respect to the minority opinion:  while all of the respondents except one found the Modules page to be at least useful, 9% found the Outcomes page to not be useful.
  
The free text responses below will provide further insight into the usefulness of the Morea standard pages and how they can be improved.

## Question 2: Morea vs. Laulima

[Laulima](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal) is the learning management system provided to all faculty at the University of Hawaii, and so most students in this survey have prior experience using it.  Laulima is less "opinionated" than Morea in that it does not require instructors to organize their course materials into modules that are themselves composed of outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments.  Laulima also provides functionality not available in Morea, such as automated assignment submission and a gradebook.  This question asked users to compare Morea to Laulima:

{% include case-study-image.html src="question2-morea-vs-laulima.png" %}

Here is a summary of the results:

{% include case-study-image.html src="question2-morea-vs-laulima-summary.png" %}

Despite the fact that Laulima was probably more familiar to users, and that it provided more functionality, 70% preferred Morea to Laulima and only 3% preferred Laulima to Morea.

The free text responses below will provide further insight into this response, and suggests that the strong preference for Morea results at least in part from its "opinionated" nature: users like the organization imposed on course materials by Morea. 

## Question 3: Morea vs. other course web sites

The next question requested user assessment of how easy Morea is to use relative to any other course website they have have encountered:

{% include case-study-image.html src="question3-morea-vs-other.png" %}

Here is a summary of the results:

{% include case-study-image.html src="question3-morea-vs-other-summary.png" %}

The preference for Morea dropped a little from Question 2, but still indicates a majority of 64% find Morea to be the easiest to use website of all they have experienced.   Later comments indicate that some students find Coursera or Khan Academy to be easier to use. 

## Question 4: What is one feature you like about Morea sites?
 
 To get a sense for the capabilities of Morea that are of special significance to users, we asked users to describe in text one thing they liked:
 
 {% include case-study-image.html src="question4-one-like.png" %}
 
 Here is an excerpt of the 100+ responses:
 
 {% include case-study-image.html src="question4-one-like-summary.png" %}
 
 To better understand this data, I read through the responses and created a "coding" based upon common themes expressed by multiple users.  Although the question requested just one item, many users responded with comments about multiple features they liked. Here is a summary of the most common types of responses:
 
#### The organization of Morea is good.
 
 Over 50 of the users indicated that they liked the organization of Morea sites. By this, I think they mean the requirement that instructors structure the material into modules with an explicit, uniform substructure.  Comments included:
 
   * The modules are all displayed very clearly and in a way that's easy to read. Everything is on each corresponding Module.
   
   * Navigating through coursework as well as the layout of text was beautiful! It felt almost as if my workload was a quest I was immersed in.  
   
   * It condenses all necessary course material into terse and easily accessible pages.
   
   * Once I figured out the navigation, I found that it was organized, making it easier to find things. e.g. If I need to look at homework, I could look under Experiences. If I need to look at slides or class notes, I could look under Readings.
   
   * It's more organized into different sections and easier to focus on the topic we are learning.
   
   * Information is easy to access and logically arranged. There's a clear connection between assignments and supporting material. 
   
   *  It is very easy to find what you want. It also takes some extra stress away from covering a module. Instead of having to find the reading materials, find the screen casts, then find the homework, they are all on the same page in an organized fashion. This makes it easier to start a module because you can just start at the beginning and watch the screencasts, rather than making excuses like "I'll start later because I'm not sure where to start."
   
#### The layout and navigation are good.

Around 45 users indicated that they liked the layout and/or navigation capabilities of Morea. Here are some of the responses reflecting this preference:

  * Searching homework assignments/screen casts was easy and clear. The clear section heading made things nice and clean. 
  
  * It condenses all necessary course material into terse and easily accessible pages.
  
  * Visually appeal/clear directions make it easy to navigate. 
  
  * The layout is great.  It's much easier to navigate and more intuitive as well. 
  
  * Everything was snappier, easier to navigate, and looked better. 
  
  * The Morea site has a clean interface and is easy to navigate through. 
  
  * I really liked how simple yet usable the Morea website is. 
   
  * The layout of Morea makes a lot more sense, it's also less straining on the eyes over longer periods of time.
  
#### It is better than Laulima.

About 18 users commented favorably about Morea in comparison to Laulima. For example:

  * The interface is very attractive and you can search for things easier than laulima.
  
  * Laulima has a lot more glitches and bugs compared to Morea. 
  
  * It didn't seem like there were features tucked away in buttons within buttons, like laulima.  
  
  * It overall feels much more responsive compared to Laulima. 
  
  * It's more reliable than Laulima and overall less frustrating in most aspects.
