# User Evaluation of the Morea Framework 

## Summary

In May, 2015, the instructors for five courses whose websites were built using the Morea Framework asked their students to fill out an online survey asking their opinion of the course website. Out of the 175 students who received the request, 119 responded, for a participation rate of 68%. One course was 200 level, two were 300 level, one was 400 level, and one was a 600 (graduate) level. Four of the courses were in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences, and one was in the Department of Information and Technology Management. All were at the University of Hawaii.

The goal of the survey was to determine if end-users find the Morea Framework to provide a useful alternative to learning management systems such as Laulima.  And if so, what changes or enhancements would end-users find desirable. 

Survey results indicate that user satisfaction with the Morea Framework course websites is quite high: 70% of respondents prefer it to Laulima in particular and 63% find it easier to use than other course websites in general.

The following sections present the data in more detail.
